# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to summarize how ride-sharing data differ by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Resources
* Data Sources: city_data.csv, ride_data.csv
* Software: Python 3.7.6; Jupyter Notebook 6.0.3

## Results 
Distinct differences exist in ride-sharing data between city types. 

* As noted in the chart below, urban locales have substantially more drivers to accommodate substantially more rides. The farther one gets from urban areas, the fewer drivers and rides.   

* And yet the more rural the location, the higher the average fare, both per ride and per driver. This could be the result of the typical distance per ride in suburban and rural areas.

* The higher fares per ride seen in rural areas were not enough to make up for the sheer volume of rides in urban areas. As seen in the chart below, total fares from urban areas were, depending on the week of the yea, 4-6 times higher than rural areas and 2-3 times higher than suburban areas.

* Week by week, total fares from rural and suburban areas were generally more consistent than from urban areas. Except for two anomalous weeks, total weekly fares for rural areas hovered around $250, whereas total weekly fares in urban areas ranged from ~$1,700 in early January to ~$2,500 in late February. Total weekly fares in suburban areas were typically around $1,000. 

## Summary

Based on an analysis of ride-sharing data, Pyber may consider the following:
