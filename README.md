# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to summarize how ride-sharing data differ by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Resources
* Data Sources: city_data.csv, ride_data.csv
* Software: Python 3.7.6; Jupyter Notebook 6.0.3

## Results 
Distinct differences exist in ride-sharing data between city types.
